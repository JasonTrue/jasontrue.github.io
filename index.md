I'm Jason Truesdell, a software developer, Seattleite, and now a resident of Kawasaki, Japan.

I've been writing code in one form or another since I was an 8 year old kid with a Texas Instruments TI-99/4A computer. I carefully avoided formally studying anything to do with computer science in college, though I sometimes helped friends with computer science homework and spend way too much time online (Bitnet, then the Internet), hosting radio shows on campus radio, and producing a music video show and news graphics for the campus TV station, and even a brief stint as an assistant editor at a community newspaper. I went on an exchange program to Germany, where I spent a lot of time cooking, studying Japanese, and learning about HTML and other internet technologies.

Somehow, I graduated with an East Asian Studies degree in 1996.

This terribly esoteric combination of activities led to my first "real" job at Microsoft in 1997, testing German and Japanese versions of Internet Explorer 4.0 for internationalization.

Fast forward to many years later, and I'm a software developer. You can hire me. Send me a [message](mailto:jason@yuzuten.com).
