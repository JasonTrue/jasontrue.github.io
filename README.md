# jasontrue.github.io

Hello. You probably don't have much reason to be looking at this repository, but if you do, here's what it's for:

It's a Jekyll-based static site hosted at https://jasontrue.github.io. It's not much to look at, but it's meant to sort of be a
calling card for my technical/professional work.

I probably won't invest much effort into this project, but it'll ultimately serve as a summary of the open source and notable personal
projects I've got online, and include a terser version of my tediously long resume.

Please don't reuse the content on here without my permission. It's probably not applicable to your life anyway. If it helps you to make
sense of Jekyll in some way, great! I have no investment in any of the configuration code here, but you're free to repurpose any 
structural stuff that makes your life easier, however unlikely that may be. Note that I don't test anything I make here that carefully,
and it's worth almost as much as the price you paid to look at it.

The text, and, if applicable, any images referenced, are almost certainly mine, and (C) 2019-last repo change date Jason Truesdell.
Icons and theme content may be copyright by other parties (see the theme to be sure).

Feel free to email if I can help you with anything (gotta job for me?) at jason@yuzuten.com.
