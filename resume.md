  Initially focused on a .Net based system, we replaced pieces of their architecture with JVM solutions
  aligned with the client's internal technology strategy. This project required me to dive deep into a complex domain,

  guidance as we replaced legacy systems with a modern, testable, service-oriented architecture in Java + Groovy,
  applying a domain driven design approach.
